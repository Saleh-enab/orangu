//! One model across several devices, by routing each weight to the device
//! its layer was placed on.
//!
//! # How this avoids touching the model code
//!
//! Every architecture in `engine::arch` reaches its backend through
//! [`Backend::matmul`], whose operand is a `QuantMatrix` — and a
//! `QuantMatrix` knows which device it belongs to, because
//! `LoadedModel::matrix` stamped it from `engine::placement`'s plan when
//! the model was built. So the routing is a lookup, and not one line of any
//! forward pass changes.
//!
//! The cross-device transfer falls out of the same shape. `Backend::matmul`
//! takes host `&[f32]` and returns host `Vec<f32>`; a layer on device 0
//! therefore *already* ends with its output in host memory, and the next
//! layer's first matmul uploads from there to device 1. There is no
//! peer-to-peer path to write and no residual to shuttle by hand: the
//! boundary crossing is the trait's existing contract, paid once per
//! matmul rather than once per boundary.
//!
//! # What a spread model keeps, and what it gives up
//!
//! The distinction is between work scoped to *one layer* and work that
//! spans layers, and it is drawn by two hooks rather than one.
//!
//! **Kept** — everything per-layer, through [`Self::as_wgpu_on`]: fused
//! attention, the fused post-attention/FFN chain, the device-side KV
//! mirror. None of it needs cross-layer state; each takes host input,
//! returns host output, and touches only that layer's weights and that
//! layer's cache. It runs on the card the layer's weights are on.
//!
//! **Given up** — everything that spans layers, because [`Self::as_wgpu`]
//! answers `None`: the whole-step decode submission (which records every
//! layer into one command buffer and drops a decode step from ~37 GPU
//! submissions to 1), GPU sampling, the logits readback. Those assume one
//! `wgpu::Device` holds the whole chain, and handing one a model split
//! across two devices would be silently wrong.
//!
//! Measured on the dev machine, release build, a 0.5B model split 3:1 over
//! two GPUs: 11.9 tok/s with the per-layer paths off, 14.9 with them on,
//! against 27.8 unsplit. So per-layer fusion is worth about a quarter, and
//! the whole-step submission is most of what remains. What a split buys is
//! still **capacity** — a model larger than any one card runs at all,
//! instead of the driver paging VRAM on every token.
//!
//! The KV mirror is safe by construction rather than by review: a layer's
//! device never changes, `sync_gpu` is only ever called from inside a
//! `VulkanBackend` (so the mirror lands on that backend's own device), and
//! `LayerCache::copy_prefix_from` drops the mirror, so no buffer can
//! survive into a cache being reused elsewhere.
//!
//! # A host layer's projections, at prefill width
//!
//! A layer the plan left on the host runs its projections on the CPU — at
//! one token that is right, the weights are already in RAM and the card
//! would spend longer fetching them than multiplying. At prefill width it
//! is not: the same weights multiply every token of the batch, so sending
//! them across the bus once per call and running the GEMM on the card
//! costs the upload plus a fraction of the host GEMM. Measured on a 48-layer
//! model split 18:30 over a card and the host, a 257-token chunk spent
//! 540 ms per host layer in three projections against 200 ms per device
//! layer for the whole of attention and the FFN.
//!
//! So [`Self::matmul`] and [`Self::matmul_batch`] send a host layer's op to
//! the first card's **streaming region** ([`VulkanBackend::matmul_batch_streamed`])
//! once the batch is [`host_stream_min_tokens`] wide. The region is bounded
//! and recycled, so the card's residency plan is untouched; the result
//! comes back to the host exactly as the CPU's would, so nothing about the
//! layer's attention or cache changes. Decode never takes it:
//! [`Self::matmul_decode`] and [`Self::matmul_batch_decode`] route to the
//! weight's own device regardless of width, for the reason
//! [`Backend::matmul_decode`] exists at all.
//!
//! # Same backend, always
//!
//! Every device here comes from one API's own enumeration, so a set can
//! never mix a Vulkan device with a CUDA one. That is worth stating rather
//! than merely being true: two vendors' kernels sum in different orders,
//! and a model split across them would produce output that depends on
//! which layers landed where — reproducible only against itself.
